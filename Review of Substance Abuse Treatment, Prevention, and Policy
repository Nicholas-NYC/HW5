This scholarly journal was published 12/20/2007 and reviews the occupational correlation of smoking among urban transit workers.  
I think this was a relevant study and have pertinent health information within.  The publication review blue-collar and service occupations 
and compares the rates of smoking to that of white-collar and professional occupations.  The paper claims that stress of job role may be a 
contributing factor and quitting behavior.  The objective was to collect 10 yearsâ€™ worth of data on a multiethnic group of urban transit operators, 
the study also accounted for demographic factors and alcohol consumption. The methods of collection reviewed 654 San Francisco Municipal railway 
labors who participated in health studies and biennial health exams.  The non-smokers over the 10 years period were compared to people who, initiated, 
maintained, increased, decreased, or quit.  Factors such as job stress, relaxation after work, and years employed with MUNI were self reported. 
The results of the study suggest that 35% of workers continued with current trends over the ten year period.  The frequency of job related problems was
significantly correlated to smoking.  And Black labors were more likely to smoke as compared to non-ethnic groups.  The journal concludes that limiting 
stress and a outreach program is important to develop policies reducing tobacco use.
